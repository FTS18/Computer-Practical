        Using different fonts and font sizes <FONT size="7">T</FONT>rees are breathing partners. We need trees in order to live. People and
        animals depend on trees and plants for oxygen. As we breathe in, our body takes in oxygen. As we breathe out,
        we give out carbon dioxide. Trees do just the opposite. They take in carbon dioxide ans then release oxygen.

        <FONT size="7">T</FONT>rees are a renewable natural resource. They can be renewed by replacing the trees that have been
        cut and planting more trees. We also depend on forest products for things like the wood and paper. Actually, here
        are more than 5,000 things that can be made from trees.
